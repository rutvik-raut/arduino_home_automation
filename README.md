# Home Automation with Backup Fail Safe System.

A Smart Home Simulation model was created which had a CFL Light and a CPU fan to simulate the regular tube light and fan respectively. An Arduino was used to control the LDR and the Temperature sensor. 

In case the sensors failed to function and turn On/Off the light and fan at appropriate times, a Bluetooth module was connected as a backup option to switch it. Commands via an Android application were sent to the Bluetooth module to do the needful switching.
